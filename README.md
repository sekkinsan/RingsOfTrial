## Introduction

Rings of Trial is a prototype of a single-player dungeon crawler game built using NativeScript, TypeScript, and Angular for the Android OS. It is my capstone for my web developer mentorship program hosted by Bloc. As a player, you will clear different rings by fighting different enemies that range from familiar characters as well as some of my personal favorites in order to escape. 

## Features

Users are able to create their own spells and engage in combat very similar to Nintendo's Pokemon, as a turn-based RPG. 

## Problems

As a capstone, I really wanted to create a game since I'm interested in video games. I didn't think it would be possible to create a working prototype of a turn-based mobile game using the NativeScript framework. I ran into many issues, especially when trying to get acclimated to TypeScript itself, since this was my first application using this technology. With some core JavaScript array functions being inaccessible, getting some of the features for this application to work properly required a lot of circumventing with trial and error.

## Results

There are still more features I hope to include in later updates for the Rings of Trial, as well as improving the combat system and add loot when enemies are defeated. I learned so much from creating this application through NativeScript, especially with how powerful NativeScript really is in the development of mobile applications for multiple platforms. My next step would be to brush up the iOS release for this prototype and continue to add rings for the player to try and escape from.
